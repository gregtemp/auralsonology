Aural Sonology

Totally descriptive
100% in the perceptual realm

3 articulation levels
- 1 sound objects - individual sounds, smallest atom, not the relationships between them
- 2 interrelations between sound objects - rhythm, pitch, textures, contours
- 3 all of it together - dynamic forms (energy), time fields (segmentation), layers/depth, transformations of ideas of the section (aka: how theme, hook, motif change)

metric notation
mini dynamic forms
goals notation
layers
